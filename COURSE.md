# Angular Signal Components

1. [ ] create an Angular Component Signal `input` function to receive data passed from the parent component
2. [ ] create an Angular Component `output` function to emit events
3. [ ] map Angular Component `output` to and from RxJS Observables
4. [ ] share state across Angular Components using Angular Signal Models

signal queries demo: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-signal-queries?file=src%2Fmain.ts
signal model demo: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-model-inputs?file=src%2Fmain.ts
model inputs: https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/54252
output function demo: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-output-fn?file=src%2Fmain.ts

With the model input you will pass a signal directly instead of a value with the signal input.

The will allow the parent component to subscribe to the child model and update the local signal.

it provides a two-way binding ðŸ˜…

The 2-way bindable signal inputs called the model inputs will allow inputs to be writable.

It maybe lead to dirty usecases, but fundamentally there is nothing wrong to update that input.

# Angular Deferrable Views

1. [ ] Defer loading components with Angular defer block
2. [ ] Defer loading directives with Angular defer block
3. [ ] Defer loading pipes with Angular defer block
4. [ ] Display @placeholder and @loading blocks while loading Angular defer block
5. [ ] Display @error block while loading Angular defer block
6. [ ] Trigger Angular defer block with `on idle`
7. [ ] Trigger Angular defer block with `on viewport`
8. [ ] Trigger Angular defer block with `on interaction`
9. [ ] Trigger Angular defer block with `on hover`
10. [ ] Trigger Angular defer block with `on immediate`
11. [ ] Trigger Angular defer block with `on timer`
12. [ ] Trigger Angular defer block with `when` clause
13. [ ] Prefetch Angular deferrable views with `prefetch` clause
